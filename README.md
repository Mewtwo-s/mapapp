## :paperclip: Description
Meedle is a location sharing app that finds an optimal spot to meet up

## :bulb: Inspiration
Have you ever wanted to meet up with friends but can‚Äôt decide where? One friend wants to grab breakfast at the spot by their apartment, while the other insists that they meet closer to their house. You get frustrated and end up cancelling all together. 
Meedle is a live location sharing application that helps friends find an optimal place to meet in the middle. It keeps track of users‚Äô real time geolocations, and uses the Google Maps API to generate a meeting place that will equalize travel time for all users. Meedle was built with React, Redux, Node.Js, Express, Socket.io, Turf.js, Nodemailer, postgreSQL, and Sequelize. Building this application, we learned how to track users‚Äô geolocation, implement API security, and manage multi-user live data sharing.
